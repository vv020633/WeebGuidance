# Weeb Guidance

Weeb Guidance is a GUI tool built atop the functionality of the Jikan anime API and the content available at https://animixplay.to/ The user can select a random episode of an anime series of their choice. This will be handy if you have a series in mind that you want to watch or simply have on in the background, but you don't have a specific episode number in mind. The search bar can be slightly unresponsive at times due to the limitations of the API, So the collection windows provides the opportunity to save titles in a collection (manually input or copy+paste a title) which can be retrieved immediately.
